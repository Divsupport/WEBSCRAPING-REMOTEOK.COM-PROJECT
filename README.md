# WEBSCRAPING-REMOTEOK.COM-PROJECT
This project scrapes remote tech jobs from RemoteOK using Python. It extracts job titles, company names, and skill tags, then saves the data into a CSV file. It uses `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` to fetch, parse, and organize job listings for easy analysis.
